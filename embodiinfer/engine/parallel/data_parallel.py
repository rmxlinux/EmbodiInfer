"""Data-parallel replicas for lossless throughput scaling.

For a compute-bound VLA (e.g. pi0.5 in fp32), a single GPU saturates and batching
plateaus. The lossless way past the plateau is data parallelism: hold a full
policy replica on each GPU, shard the incoming requests across replicas, and run
them concurrently. No numerics change — each request is served by exactly one
replica exactly as a single-GPU engine would serve it.

The module is factored into three replaceable pieces so the policy for *where* a
request runs, *how* replicas run concurrently, and *what* a replica is are all
independent:

    * :class:`Replica`        — one policy copy pinned to one device.
    * :class:`Dispatcher`     — assigns requests to replicas (round-robin / load).
    * :class:`ReplicaExecutor`— runs the per-replica work concurrently.

:class:`DataParallelEngine` wires them together, preserves caller request order
and ids, and turns a replica failure into a typed :class:`ReplicaExecutionError`.

Concurrency backend. The default :class:`ThreadedExecutor` uses one OS thread per
replica. This is not a GIL bottleneck for the reason it would be in pure Python:
a replica spends its time inside CUDA kernel launches and device execution, both
of which release the GIL, so replicas on distinct devices run in true parallel
(measured near-linear across 4x H200). The Python-side pre-processing each thread
does before launching (collate / tokenize) *does* hold the GIL and would
serialize as the replica count grows; a :class:`ProcessExecutor` (stub below)
would remove that at the cost of tensor IPC and per-process weight loading. At the
current few-replica scale the threaded pre-processing is not the bottleneck.
